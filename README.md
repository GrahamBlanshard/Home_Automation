Personal project by Graham Blanshard. Code is free to use, no warranty, guarantee etc. etc. etc.

Code is written to function on a Raspberry Pi using standard features. Schematics, pictures and the like will probably be published alongside the code when its ready. Feel free to ask questions if anything is documented poorly, this is primarily a personal repository for anyone to use as they see fit.

Planned features:
=====

`Pi #1 (Garage Pi) - Garage control from Android`

* Motion camera 
* Door open/close detections
* Motion Light
* 24/7 Logging to database

`Pi #2 (Sump Pi) - Sump Pump Features`

* Water level reading
* High level alarm & notification

`Repo details:`

dir python_code - Test code that I'm learning IO with the PI and camera
